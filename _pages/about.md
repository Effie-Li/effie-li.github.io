I recently started as a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind. I am broadly interested in machine and human cognition, including reasoning, planning, and the mechanisms that support these abilities in deep learning models and the human brain. 

My PhD research investigated a learning theory of task decomposition in transformers and humans. I also worked on multi-modal LLM evaluation and embodied AI as interns at Meta and AI2, and spent time building neural decoders of human episodic memory at UPenn.
